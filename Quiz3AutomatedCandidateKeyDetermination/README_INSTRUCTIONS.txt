To just run the program:
Change directory to CompiledJarFile and run the jar file using the following command:
java -jar CandidateKeyDetermination.jar
I have also provided an executable if it is run for windows systems but I assumed that the question asked it to be able to run on any OS so 
I provided the appropriate jar files. 
It can also be run using the exe named CandidateKeyDetermination.exe on windows systems or by 
using the CandidateKeyDetermination on linux systems with ./CandidateKeyDetermination from linux terminal provided JVM is available
